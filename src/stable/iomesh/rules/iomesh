  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: Critical
  annotations:
    summary: The storage status of node {{ $labels.name }} is unhealthy.
    description: The storage node is not working properly, either because it is restarting or has been shut down, or its services are not started.

- alert: High node storage usage
  expr: sum(zbs_chunk_data_space_use_rate) by (_chunk,name) > 90
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: Critical
  annotations:
    summary: Storage usage of node {{ $labels.name }} exceeds 90%.
    description: This node has high data space usage. Note that space usage includes space that has not been reclaimed yet and may differ from the storage node space usage shown.
    impact: Data migration might be triggered to achieve automatic storage balancing across multiple nodes.
    solution: It is recommended to add physical disks to the node or add nodes. If a host is added, data migration will be triggered.
